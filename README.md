> # THE PROJECT IS Work in progress

# Motivations

With this project I am looking in creating an improved version of the IMDb UI. I find the current UI being overloaded with information and clunky; for an experienced user this is not a problem, but for someone that is visiting the website for the first time it can be overwhelming.

# Tech stack

### Front End

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- TailwindCSS
- React

### Back End

- NodeJS
- ORM: TBD
- MySql or SQLite

### Other:

- Vite

# Goals

- Intuitive and easy-to-use UI, especially for new users
- Responsive Design - has to work well on all devices (Mobile, Tablets, Desktop, TVs)
- Minimal BackEnd with NodeJS and a database (SQLite/MySql)
- Greatly improve my skills with the following technologies:
  - HTML, CSS (Tailwind), JavaScript
  - React
  - React Packages: Router, Framer and more
  - NodeJS
  - DataBases
- Create a strong portfolio piece

# Changed from the original IMDb

- Moved the IMDb Pro button from the Navbar to Profile
- Created an options button on the Navbar for:
  - Language
  - Light / Dark Mode
- Moved the Language selector to the User Dropdown
