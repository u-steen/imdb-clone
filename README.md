> # THE PROJECT IS Work in progress

# Motivations

With this project I am looking in creating an improved version of the IMDb UI. I find the current UI being overloaded with information and clunky; for an experienced user this is not a problem, but for someone that is visiting the website for the first time it can be overwhelming.

# Goals

- Intuitive and easy-to-use UI, especially for new users
- Minimal BackEnd with NodeJS and a database (SQLite/MySql)
- Greatly improve my skills with the following technologies:
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  - React
  - Design Software: Figma
  - NodeJS
  - DataBases

# TODO

  - [ ] Main Page
  - [ ] Movie Page

  - [ ] User Page
  - [ ] Movie List Page (for collections)
- [ ] Backend
  - [ ] WebAPI
  - [ ] Database
